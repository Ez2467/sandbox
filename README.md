# How applications are reviewed

### Frequency

The TOC reviews sandbox applications approximately **every two months** as of June 2020 in a non-public meeting; referred to as "session" hereafter.

### Quantity

The TOC attempts to work through approximately 7-10 applications per session. How many are actually reviewed in a session varies greatly between each session. Every project is unique and may warrant different areas of attention to be elevated for more in-depth discussion, depending on the nature and function of the project.

Each TOC member prepares for these sessions by performing an independent review of those projects scheduled for discussion at the next session prior to that session. They'll keep their notes on hand for when the project is up for discussion.

### Review order

Sandbox applications are traditionally reviewed in a First In, First Out (FIFO) ordering as they appear on the **üèó Upcoming** Column of the [Sandbox Application Board](https://github.com/orgs/cncf/projects/14/views/1) by their corresponding issue number. The only exception is where projects are `Returning` for review. Projects that are `Returning` are prioritized for re-review as they had previously been subject to a review and have completed their outstanding asks. In cases where a project was `Postponed` and has substantial changes since last review, a new issue is opened, linked to the previous, and reviewed as a new application. 

Applications are moved from appromax two weeks prior to the next scheduled session by the TOC or support staff.

# Discussions and decision

During the course of the session, the TOC will actively discuss the project based on the information provided in the issue as well as other observations the TOC has about the project. Those observan and may be subject to each TOC member area of domain expert, personal experience, community feedback, or other factor During the course of active discussion, the TOC may identify areas the project needs to work on, complete, or allow to happen that could inhibit its acceptance into the CNCF. These areas will be captured success and affixed the corresponding label see Label statuses defined  for more information The issue will also receive a comment that details the additional areas that correspond with the label. The TOC comment may be format as a checklist or may be presented as text.
